## Suggested Loom Demo Script (3-Minute Flow)

1. **The Upload (0:00 - 0:45)**:
   - "Welcome to the AI Legal Doc Analyzer. Today I'll show you how we can perform a deep risk assessment on a contract in seconds."
   - Drag and drop a sample PDF (e.g., an NDA or Service Agreement).
   - Point out the progress UI: "The app is currently extracting text, chunking it semantically, and generating embeddings for our in-memory vector store."

2. **Risk Assessment (0:45 - 2:00)**:
   - "Once processed, we land in the workspace. I'll hit 'Generate Risk Report'."
   - Show the result: "Notice the risk score and the structured red flags. Each flag is tied back to the contract with exact evidence quotes."
   - Click through the tabs: "We can see the executive summary, critical flags like auto-renewals, and even a negotiation strategy suggested by the AI."

3. **Grounded Chat (2:00 - 3:00)**:
   - "Finally, let's use the Grounded Chat. I'll ask: 'What is the liability cap?'."
   - Show the assistant response: "The answer isn't just generated; it's retrieved from the specific chunks of the PDF. You can see the sources cited right below the message, ensuring zero hallucinations."
   - Wrap up: "Premium, fast, and grounded. That's the AI Legal Doc Analyzer."
